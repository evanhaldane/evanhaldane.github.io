### Professional
I'm a mathematician / data scientist / programmer. I like asking questions. Recently, I've become even more interested in answering them. I've worked at [Invenia](https://invenia.ca) using machine learning to forecast prices and usage in electricity markets and at [SeatGeek](https://seatgeek.com) analyzing effectiveness of  marketing campaigns and UX decisions. I previously did my graduate work in spectral theory under [Dmitry Jakobson](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/jakobson/) at [McGill University](http://www.mcgill.ca/).

### Personal

I enjoy orienteering, which I do with the [Ramblers Orienteering Club](http://www.ramblersoc.ca/). I also like sabermetrics and hockey analytics. I'll occasionally post related things about these here.
