### Professional
I'm a Senior Data Scientist at [Invenia](http://invenia.ca) where I work on machine learning algorithms for forecasting of prices and usage in electricity markets. I previously studied spectral theory under [Dmitry Jakobson](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/jakobson/) at [McGill University](http://www.mcgill.ca/).

#### Tools that are awesome and that you should check out:

### Personal

I'm an avid fan of the [Montreal Canadiens](http://canadiens.nhl.com/index.html), with a slight affinity for the [Winnipeg Jets](http://jets.nhl.com). I've recently started venturing into the hockey analytics world, and I post my findings here from time to time.
