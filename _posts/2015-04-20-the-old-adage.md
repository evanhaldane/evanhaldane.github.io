It's NHL playoff time, and wisdom abounds. One such adage I've already heard a dozen times is "You're never in trouble until you lose at home." Just last year, three teams won their series after dropping the first two on the road: [Minnesota over Colorado](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Stanley_Cup_playoffs#.28C1.29_Colorado_Avalanche_vs._.28WC1.29_Minnesota_Wild), [Chicago over St. Louis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Stanley_Cup_playoffs#.28C2.29_St._Louis_Blues_vs._.28C3.29_Chicago_Blackhawks), and [Los Angeles over San Jose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Stanley_Cup_playoffs#.28P2.29_San_Jose_Sharks_vs._.28P3.29_Los_Angeles_Kings). However, last season was an exception, and even so, the other three teams who went down 2-0 on the road eventually lost the series.

If we look further back, teams that lose the first two games on the road have won [30 out of 256 series](http://www.whowins.com/tables/up20.html), or 11.7%. Ooof. Even if we restrict ourselves to the Conference Quarterfinals (which have come about in an era with greater parity), it doesn't look much better, at [11 series victories out of 77](http://www.whowins.com/tables/up20.html) or 14.3%.

Fourteen percent isn't exactly a longshot, but I think it's fair to characterize it as 'trouble'. That's roughly the chance that you'll find two people with the same people in a [group of 11 people](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=birthday+problem+11+people).
