title:  "Game of Life with k-means clustering"

I wanted to learn React.js by building something with it. I also wanted something at least marginally more interesting than a Todo app. Conway's Game of life seemed like a good choice, though that has certainly been done before. I haven't seen any kind of partitioning / clustering of the 'lives'. So I threw k-means clustering on top of it at each step. It works pretty well, at least for my parameters.
