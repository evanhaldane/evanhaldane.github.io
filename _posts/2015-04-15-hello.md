A website. Finally. Well over a decade has passed since [@bluetshirt](http://twitter.com/bluetshirt) and I made a frame-laden website to fulfill our science project requirement (a rightful recepient of a Bronze medal IIRC). These days my HTML skills are about the same. However, I'm hoping that I may have some actual content of interest now. We shall see.

Note: I'm using [Poole](http://getpoole.com/), the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) butler to make this site.
