## Projects

- [Pushups](/pushups/): After a suggestion from a friend, I set the goal of 10,000 pushups in a year. I graphed the results. The software challenge was successful. The hardware challenge was not.

- [WAR visualizer](/war-visualizer/): A little tool to visualize baseball career trajectories, using D3.js.

- [Game of Clusters](https://evanhaldane.github.io/life): An implementation of Conway's Game of Life with k-means clustering on top. Built using React.js.
